## Types of Social Media Crises

### Level 1 — Isolated Negative Comment
Single negative reply or DM. Low urgency.
*Response time: Within 24 hours*

### Level 2 — Repeated Criticism
Multiple people making the same critique. Signals a real issue.
*Response time: Within 4–8 hours*

### Level 3 — Viral Backlash
Post is being shared negatively, ratio'd, or screenshotted in critical contexts.
*Response time: Within 1–2 hours*

### Level 4 — Reputational Crisis
Serious accusations, misinformation spreading, or content causing real harm.
*Response time: Immediate — and involve legal/PR if applicable*

## The 4-Step Response Framework

### 1. PAUSE — Don't react immediately
- Step away for 15–30 minutes before responding
- Read every critical comment before replying to any
- Identify the pattern: Is this one troll or a legitimate concern?
- Screenshot everything (you may need a record)

### 2. ASSESS — Determine the right response type

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Factual error in your post | Acknowledge and correct |
| Opinion you disagree with | Engage thoughtfully or ignore |
| Personal attack / troll | Ignore or hide/block |
| Legitimate grievance | Acknowledge, apologize if warranted |
| Misinformation about you | Correct calmly with facts |
| Coordinated attack | Don't engage — document and report |

### 3. RESPOND — With these principles

**If you were wrong:**
```
"I got this wrong — [what was incorrect].

The accurate information is: [correction].

Thank you to [person] for pointing this out. I'll be more careful."
```

**If it's a misunderstanding:**
```
"I can see how that read as [their interpretation].

What I meant was [clarification].

Fair feedback — I'll be clearer next time."
```

**If it's a troll or bad-faith attack:**
Don't respond. Hide, mute, or block. Engaging rewards the behavior and extends reach.

**If there's a legitimate grievance from a customer/community:**
- Acknowledge publicly, resolve privately
- "DM me and I'll make this right" > defensive public debate
- Follow through — people watch to see if you do

### 4. LEARN — After the crisis passes

- What triggered the response?
- Was the critique valid?
- What would you post differently?
- Do you need a content review process?
- Update your pre-publish checklist

## Responding to Negative Comments

### Do:
- Respond to thoughtful criticism with genuine engagement
- Thank people for corrections (builds trust)
- Keep responses short — long defensive replies look guilty
- Stay in your lane: you don't have to respond to everything

### Don't:
- Delete critical comments (unless they violate platform rules or are abusive) — it signals you have something to hide
- Argue with trolls (you cannot win; they have infinite time)
- Post emotional responses — write it, wait 30 min, then decide
- Like your own responses to criticism (looks defensive)

### The Ratio Test
If replies > likes on your post and people are quote-posting critically, you're being "ratio'd". Options:
- Add a clarifying reply that addresses the main critique
- Pin a correction if the post has factual errors
- Let it pass — most "ratio" moments are forgotten in 48 hours
- Delete only if the post caused genuine harm

## When a Post Goes Wrong (Playbook)

### If the post has a factual error:
1. Edit post immediately (or delete if edit changes meaning)
2. Add a top comment: "Update: [correction]"
3. If significant: post a correction post

### If the post is being misread:
1. Add clarifying comment immediately
2. Don't delete unless it's causing active harm
3. Accept that some misreadings are user errors — don't over-explain

### If the post offended people unintentionally:
1. Don't get defensive — read the feedback first
2. If the offense is valid: genuine apology, no "if anyone was offended" language
3. If invalid: calm clarification once, then move on
4. Never: delete + pretend it didn't happen when people have screenshots

### If the post went viral in a bad direction:
1. Don't feed the algorithm by engaging with every critic
2. Post normally after 24–48 hours (signals confidence)
3. Address it once, clearly, then move forward
4. Disable notifications temporarily if the volume is overwhelming

## Pre-Publish Crisis Prevention Checklist

Before publishing sensitive, opinionated, or data-heavy content:

- [ ] **Facts verified** — Is every statistic, claim, or attribution accurate?
- [ ] **Tone check** — Could this be read as dismissive, exclusionary, or arrogant?
- [ ] **Audience check** — Could this alienate a segment of your audience you value?
- [ ] **Timing check** — Is this insensitive given current events?
- [ ] **Screenshot test** — Would you be comfortable with this as a standalone screenshot without context?
- [ ] **Misread test** — What's the worst-faith interpretation of this post?
- [ ] **Legal check** — Does this make claims about competitors, name individuals, or share confidential info?

The goal isn't to avoid all controversy — thoughtful contrarian takes build audiences. The goal is to avoid *careless* controversy.
