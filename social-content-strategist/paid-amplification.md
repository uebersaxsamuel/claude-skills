Boost what's already working. Paid social amplifies organic success — it doesn't replace it.

## When to Boost (and When Not To)

### Boost when:
- A post is organically performing well (already has strong engagement rate)
- You have a clear conversion goal (lead magnet, event signup, offer)
- Your audience is well-defined and targetable
- You have a landing page / destination that converts

### Don't boost when:
- The organic post has low engagement (paid won't fix bad content)
- You have no clear CTA or next step
- Your targeting is too broad ("everyone aged 25–65")
- You're boosting for vanity metrics (likes, followers) — low ROI

**Rule:** Organic engagement above 3% (LinkedIn) or 5% (Instagram) = good boost candidate.

## LinkedIn Ads Strategy

### Best use cases:
- Lead generation (LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms — highest-converting)
- Event promotion (webinar, workshop registrations)
- Thought leadership reach expansion
- Hiring (Sponsored Job posts)

### Targeting options (unique to LinkedIn):
- Job title, seniority, function
- Company size, industry, company name
- Skills, interests, groups
- Lookalike audiences from your customer list

### Ad formats:
| Format | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| Sponsored Content (post boost) | Awareness + engagement |
| Lead Gen Form | Lead capture without leaving LinkedIn |
| Message Ad | Direct outreach to specific titles |
| Document Ad | Carousel/PDF content |
| Conversation Ad | Interactive multi-step flow |

### Budget framework (starting out):
- $300–500/month for awareness campaigns
- $500–1000/month for lead generation
- CPC target: $5–15 for B2B (normal range for LinkedIn)
- CPL target: $50–200 depending on deal size

### Boosting organic posts on LinkedIn:
1. Go to post → "Boost" button
2. Select objective: Awareness or Engagement
3. Set audience: Use saved audiences or job title targeting
4. Budget: $50–200 for a 7–14 day test
5. Measure: Engagement rate + profile visits + DMs received

## Meta (Instagram / Facebook) Ads Strategy

### Best use cases:
- Growing email list with lead magnet
- Retargeting website visitors
- Event/offer promotion to warm audiences
- Brand awareness for visual products/services

### Audience types:
| Audience | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Saved Audience | Interest and demographic targeting |
| Custom Audience | Website visitors, email list, video viewers |
| Lookalike Audience | Similar to your best customers |
| Advantage+ | Meta's AI-driven broad targeting (often best performance) |

### Boosting Instagram posts:
1. Find your top-performing post (high saves + shares)
2. Tap "Boost Post"
3. Objective: Profile visits (brand) or Website traffic (leads)
4. Audience: Custom (your followers) or similar interest targeting
5. Budget: $5–20/day for 7 days as a test
6. Measure: Cost per click, profile visits, link clicks

### Ad creative that works:
- Native-looking content (not "ad-looking")
- Reels / video outperform static images consistently
- User-generated content style > polished production
- First 3 seconds must hook or people scroll

---

## Twitter/X Ads Strategy

### Best use cases:
- Growing followers in a niche
- App installs
- Promoting a thread or high-value content
- Event hashtag amplification

### Promoted Tweets:
- Boost threads that have already proven engagement
- Target by interests, keywords, follower lookalikes
- Minimum $10/day — short bursts (3–5 days) work well

### Limitations:
- Higher CPM than Meta
- Weaker targeting options than LinkedIn or Meta
- Algorithm changes make performance less predictable

---

## Budget Framework

### Starter (testing, <$500/month):
- Pick ONE platform and ONE objective
- LinkedIn: $300 on lead gen form for 1 month
- Meta: $200 on boosting top posts + retargeting website visitors

### Growth ($500–2000/month):
- LinkedIn: $800–1200 on lead gen + document ads
- Meta: $400–800 on lookalike audiences + retargeting
- Measure CPL, not just CPC

### Scale ($2000+/month):
- Layer platforms: LinkedIn for demand gen, Meta for retargeting
- Test multiple creatives (3–5 variations per campaign)
- Install proper tracking: Meta Pixel, LinkedIn Insight Tag, UTM parameters

## The Organic-First Workflow

This is the highest-ROI approach to paid social:

```
1. Post content organically
2. Monitor for 48–72 hours
3. If engagement rate > 3% (LinkedIn) or > 5% (Instagram) → boost
4. Set small budget ($50–150) for 7–14 days
5. Measure results (profile visits, DMs, link clicks, leads)
6. Double down on what worked
7. Build a swipe file of winning content to use as ad creative
```

**Why this works:**
- You only pay to amplify proven content
- Reduces creative risk dramatically
- Algorithm already validated the message — paid just extends reach
- No wasted budget on untested creative
