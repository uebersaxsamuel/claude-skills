# Profile Optimization

Your profile is your landing page. Every post that performs drives people here — if they don't convert, the content was wasted.

## LinkedIn Profile Optimization

### Banner (1584 x 396px)
- Communicate your value proposition visually
- Include your name, role, and one key outcome you deliver
- Use brand colors — consistency across platforms builds recognition
- Tools: Canva, Adobe Express

### Profile Photo
- Professional but approachable (no passport photo energy)
- Face fills 60–70% of the frame
- Consistent with other platforms

### Headline (220 chars)
The most important field — visible in search results and post previews.

**Formula:** `[Who you help] → [Outcome you deliver] | [Credibility marker]`

Examples:
```
❌ "Marketing Manager at Acme Corp"
✅ "I help B2B SaaS founders grow on LinkedIn → 3x pipeline in 90 days | Ex-HubSpot"

❌ "Entrepreneur | Speaker | Coach"
✅ "Turning 7-figure founders into thought leaders | LinkedIn Strategy | 500+ clients"
```

### About Section
- First 2 lines visible before "see more" — make them count
- Tell the story of who you help and how
- Include social proof (numbers, notable clients, outcomes)
- End with a clear CTA: "DM me [keyword] for [free resource]"
- Use line breaks — no walls of text

### Featured Section
Pinned content visible on profile — use it for:
- Your best-performing post
- Lead magnet / free resource
- Link to newsletter, podcast, or website
- Case study or testimonial

### Experience & Skills
- Optimize for LinkedIn search: include keywords in experience descriptions
- Top 5 skills should be endorsed — ask colleagues
- Creator mode: enable for newsletter and featured hashtags

## Instagram Profile Optimization

### Username
- Keep it consistent with other platforms
- Easy to remember, easy to spell
- Avoid numbers and underscores if possible

### Name Field (searchable)
- Include your primary keyword here: "Sam | LinkedIn Coach"
- This field is indexed by Instagram search

### Bio (150 chars)
```
Line 1: Who you are / what you do
Line 2: Who you help + outcome
Line 3: Proof or personality
Line 4: CTA + link
```

Example:
```
Content strategist 📍 Zürich
Helping founders build audiences that convert
15M+ organic impressions for clients
👇 Free LinkedIn Audit
```

### Profile Photo
- Same photo as LinkedIn — brand consistency
- High contrast — visible at small size

### Link in Bio
- Use a link aggregator: Linktree, Stan Store, or custom landing page
- Max 3–5 links (more = paralysis)
- Update seasonally or when promoting something specific

### Story Highlights
Treat these as permanent navigation for your profile:
- "About me" — introduction
- "Client wins" — social proof
- "Free resources" — lead magnets
- "How I work" — services explainer

---

## Twitter/X Profile Optimization

### Bio (160 chars)
- State what you tweet about and who it's for
- Include one credential or proof point
- Optional: personality line

Example:
```
Building in public | SaaS founder → $0 to $1M ARR
I tweet about growth, GTM, and what actually works
Prev: 2x exits
```

### Pinned Tweet
- Your highest-performing thread or post
- A lead magnet offer ("RT and I'll DM you...")
- An introduction thread
- Update quarterly

### Header Image (1500 x 500px)
- Reinforce your niche / brand
- Can include a tagline or social proof

---

## TikTok Profile Optimization

### Bio (80 chars)
- Hook your niche immediately: "I help marketers get leads from TikTok"
- Include your primary offer or differentiator
- Emoji for visual break

### Link
- Business accounts can add website link
- Direct to landing page, not homepage

### Profile Video
- 6-second intro that plays on loop on your profile
- State your niche and value immediately

---

## Link-in-Bio Strategy

### What to link
Prioritize by business goal:
1. **Lead magnet** — grows email list (highest leverage)
2. **Newsletter signup** — owned audience
3. **Booking page** — direct revenue
4. **Top content** — builds authority (podcast, YouTube, blog)
5. **Product/offer** — only after trust is established

### Aggregator vs. Landing Page
| Option | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| Linktree / Beacons | Multiple links, quick setup |
| Custom landing page | Brand consistency, tracking |
| Single URL | One clear CTA, highest conversion |

### Best Practice
- One primary CTA at the top
- Update the URL seasonally with a UTM parameter to track social traffic
- A/B test bio CTAs: "Link in bio" vs. "Grab the free guide below"
