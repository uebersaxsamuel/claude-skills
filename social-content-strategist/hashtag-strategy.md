## LinkedIn Hashtag Strategy

**How many:** 3–5 per post (more = spammy, less reach)

**Types to combine:**
- 1 broad hashtag (1M+ followers): #marketing, #leadership
- 2 mid-size hashtags (50k–500k): #contentmarketing, #b2bsales
- 1–2 niche hashtags (5k–50k): #linkedingrowth, #saasfounder

**Rules:**
- Place hashtags at the end of the post — never in the middle of sentences
- Only follow hashtags you'd genuinely use; LinkedIn shows your posts to hashtag followers
- Check hashtag follower count before using (type # in post composer to see count)
- Rotate hashtags — don't use the same 5 every post

**What to avoid:**
- #like, #follow, #comment — flagged as engagement bait
- Irrelevant hashtags just because they're popular
- More than 5 hashtags (signals spam)

## Instagram Hashtag Strategy

**How many:** 3–5 focused hashtags (Instagram recommends fewer since 2022)

**Types to combine:**
- 1 community hashtag: #foodphotography, #femalefounder
- 1–2 niche hashtags: #austinrestaurant, #saasmarketing
- 1 branded hashtag: #yourbrand or campaign-specific

**Placement options:**
- In caption (after text, separated by line break)
- In first comment (hides clutter, same reach)

**What works in 2024:**
- Fewer, more relevant hashtags outperform spray-and-pray
- Keyword-optimized captions now matter more than hashtags alone
- Branded hashtags build community UGC over time

**What to avoid:**
- Banned hashtags (check with #[hashtag] search — no top posts = likely banned)
- Repeating the same hashtag set on every post (can trigger shadowban)
- Hashtags with 10M+ posts (your content drowns immediately)

## Twitter/X Hashtag Strategy

**How many:** 0–2 per tweet

**When to use:**
- Joining a trending conversation: use the trending hashtag
- Niche communities: #buildinpublic, #indiedev, #b2bmarketing
- Events and chats: #marketingtwitter, conference hashtags

**When NOT to use:**
- Regular tweets and threads — hashtags add noise without benefit on X
- Promotional content (looks spammy)

## TikTok Hashtag Strategy

**How many:** 3–6 per video

**Types to combine:**
- 1–2 trending hashtags (check Discover tab daily)
- 2–3 niche hashtags relevant to content
- 1 content-type hashtag: #LearnOnTikTok, #TikTokTips

**Important:**
- TikTok's algorithm is keyword-driven — captions matter as much as hashtags
- Use hashtags in captions naturally when possible: "Here are my top #productivitytips..."
- Check the Discover tab for daily trending hashtags in your niche

## Hashtag Research Framework

### Step 1: Seed Research
Start with 5 obvious hashtags in your niche. Note their follower/post count.

### Step 2: Expand
For each seed hashtag, check:
- "Related hashtags" suggestions in platform
- What top posts in that hashtag use
- What rising creators in your niche use

### Step 3: Categorize
Build a hashtag bank organized by:
```
Broad (1M+):    #marketing, #business, #entrepreneur
Mid (50k–500k): #contentmarketing, #b2bmarketing
Niche (5k–50k): #linkedincreator, #saasfounder
Branded:        #yourcompanyname, #yourcampaign
```

### Step 4: Rotate
Create 3–5 hashtag sets and rotate them across posts. Don't use the same set every time.

### Step 5: Measure
Track which hashtag combinations drive:
- Impressions from hashtag (LinkedIn shows this in analytics)
- Discovery reach (Instagram shows "from hashtags" in insights)
- New followers attributed to specific posts
