## Threads (Meta)

**Best for:** Brand awareness, conversational content, Twitter/X alternative
**Audience:** 18–45, currently skewing creative / lifestyle / brand accounts
**Posting frequency:** 2–5x per day
**Status:** Rapidly growing — early mover advantage still available

**What works:**
- Casual, conversational posts (lower polish than LinkedIn)
- Questions that invite debate
- Behind-the-scenes and personal takes
- Cross-posting Twitter/X content with minimal adaptation
- Replies and engagement with creators in your niche

**What doesn't:**
- Overly promotional content
- Highly formatted posts (no bold/bullet support)
- Link-heavy posts (links not clickable in feed as of mid-2024)

**Format tips:**
- No hashtag algorithm — keywords in text matter more
- Thread format (like Twitter) works well
- Instagram integration: Threads profile tied to IG — same audience base
- Alt text and accessibility features improving

**Algorithm:**
- Very early stage — high reach for accounts who post consistently
- Replies and follows from IG audience carry over
- "For You" feed is highly active — non-followers discover you easily

**Strategy for adoption:**
1. Claim your username immediately (matches Instagram handle)
2. Repost adapted Twitter/X content daily
3. Engage heavily with replies — algorithm rewards conversations
4. Cross-promote from Instagram Stories

## Bluesky

**Best for:** Tech, media, journalists, creator communities
**Audience:** Ex-Twitter power users, tech-savvy early adopters
**Posting frequency:** 3–10x per day
**Status:** Growing niche — valuable for specific audiences

**What works:**
- Everything that worked on old Twitter (2018–2020 era)
- Threads and thoughtful takes
- Starter packs for community building
- Direct engagement with niche communities

**Unique features:**
- Starter Packs — curated follow lists to grow fast on arrival
- Feeds — custom algorithmic feeds users subscribe to

## YouTube Shorts

**Best for:** Extending YouTube presence, video-first brands, SEO
**Audience:** All ages — broad reach via YouTube's massive base
**Posting frequency:** 3–5x per week
**Status:** Strong growth — benefits from YouTube's search engine

**What works:**
- Educational quick tips (under 60 seconds)
- Behind-the-scenes snippets
- Repurposed TikTok / Instagram Reels content
- "Part 1 of..." series that drives long-form views

**What doesn't:**
- Watermarked content from TikTok/Instagram (penalized)
- Horizontal video
- Pure talking-head without visual interest

**Format tips:**
- 9:16 vertical, under 60 seconds for Shorts classification
- Hook in first 2 seconds — same as TikTok
- Add chapters and descriptions (YouTube is a search engine)
- Use Shorts to grow subscribers, then convert to long-form views

**Key advantage over TikTok/Reels:**
- Content is searchable long-term (evergreen)
- Subscribers transfer to main channel
- YouTube monetization available

## LinkedIn Newsletter

**Best for:** Thought leadership, audience ownership on LinkedIn
**Audience:** Your LinkedIn connections + newsletter subscribers
**Frequency:** Weekly or biweekly
**Status:** Underutilized — significant organic reach available

**Why it matters:**
- Subscribers get push notifications for every issue (unlike posts)
- LinkedIn promotes newsletters in discovery tab
- Builds owned audience within LinkedIn ecosystem
- Articles rank on Google (LinkedIn has high domain authority)

**What works:**
- Weekly industry roundup with your commentary
- Deep-dive analysis of one topic
- Case studies from your work
- Q&A format ("Reader question answered")

**Setup:**
1. Creator Mode must be enabled
2. Creator Hub → Newsletter → Create
3. Choose a consistent name and publish cadence
4. Promote each issue as a regular post

**Growth tactics:**
- Mention newsletter in every relevant post
- Add newsletter link to profile Featured section
- Cross-promote in email newsletter
- Invite existing email subscribers to subscribe on LinkedIn

- Good for AMAs, panel discussions, niche community building
- Notify attendees in advance via event + post

## When to Add a New Platform

### Green lights (add now):
- Your target audience is actively there
- Organic reach is still high (early platform phase)
- You can repurpose existing content with minimal adaptation
- You have bandwidth to engage, not just post

### Red lights (wait):
- You're not consistently posting on your primary platforms yet
- The audience doesn't match your ICP
- Content creation requires too much new production
- You'd be posting into a void (no audience overlap)

### Framework: Repurpose First
Before creating new content for a new platform, ask:
1. Can I repurpose from Platform A?
2. Does it need adaptation or just reformatting?
3. Is 1 hour/week enough to test it for 90 days?

If yes to all three → test it.
