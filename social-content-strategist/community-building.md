## What Makes a Community vs. an Audience

| Audience | Community |
|----------|-----------|
| Passive consumers | Active participants |
| One-to-many communication | Many-to-many communication |
| Dependent on your content | Generates own content/discussion |
| Leaves when you stop posting | Stays and creates value independently |
| Hard to monetize deeply | High monetization potential |

**The goal:** Start with audience, convert to community.

## Community Platforms by Type

| Goal | Platform |
|------|---------|
| Professional niche | LinkedIn Group, Circle |
| Real-time discussion | Discord, Slack |
| General community | Facebook Group |
| Creator monetization | Patreon, Substack |
| Live audio | LinkedIn Audio, X Spaces, Clubhouse |
| Course + community | Kajabi, Teachable, Skool |

## The 3-Phase Community Building Framework

### Phase 1: ATTRACT (Months 1–3)
Build audience first — community without audience is an empty room.

- Post consistently on 1–2 platforms
- Use content pillars that speak to your target community member
- Identify and engage your "super fans" (consistent commenters)
- Ask questions in posts — train your audience to respond
- Start a hashtag or series that invites participation: "#MondayMistake", "#BuildInPublic"

### Phase 2: ACTIVATE (Months 3–6)
Convert passive followers into active participants.

- Launch a LinkedIn Newsletter — push notifications create habit
- Host a monthly LinkedIn Audio or X Spaces event
- Create a free community space (Discord, Slack, or Circle)
- Run a challenge (30-day content challenge, audit swap)
- Feature community members in your content — people stay where they feel seen

**Activation triggers:**
- "DM me [word] and I'll send you..."
- "Comment below and I'll reply to every one"
- "Tag a [peer] who needs to hear this"
- "Join our free [community name] — link in bio"

### Phase 3: SUSTAIN (Month 6+)
Create systems so the community runs itself.

- Assign community roles / moderators
- Create weekly rituals: Monday wins, Friday questions
- Develop member spotlights
- Build onboarding (what to do when you join)
- Introduce member-generated content prompts
- Celebrate milestones: member count, anniversaries, wins

## LinkedIn Community Strategies

### LinkedIn Newsletter as Community Hub
- Consistent newsletter = consistent touchpoint
- Encourage replies (LinkedIn notifies you)
- Feature reader questions in next issue
- Create a thread in comments for discussion

### LinkedIn Audio Events
- Weekly or monthly live audio
- Format options: AMA, panel, industry roundup, hot takes
- Promote 5–7 days in advance via event + posts
- Record for repurposing (external tool)
- Follow all attendees after the event

### Engagement Pods (use ethically)
- Small group of 10–15 peers who genuinely engage each other's content
- Comment with real insight — not "great post!"
- Focus on quality, not automation
- Tools like Lempod automate this — avoid (violates ToS, looks spammy)

---

## Twitter/X Spaces & Communities

### X Spaces (Live Audio)
- Best for: Real-time conversation, trending topic discussions
- Schedule recurring "office hours" in your niche
- Promote with a tweet + Space reminder
- Host collaboratively with another creator (cross-audience growth)
- Record and share as a thread recap

### X Communities
- Niche-specific groups within X
- Join relevant communities and post value (not just self-promo)
- Create your own community around a niche topic
- Community posts don't appear in main feed — more intimate

---

## Facebook & LinkedIn Groups

### When Groups Work
- You have an existing audience to seed it
- Clear niche and purpose (not "general marketing")
- You or a moderator can be active daily
- You have a lead magnet or course to promote through the group

### Group Growth Tactics
- Pin a welcome post and onboarding instructions
- Weekly prompts to drive discussion
- Exclusive content not available elsewhere
- Challenges with clear start/end dates
- Feature member wins publicly

### What Kills Groups
- No moderation (spam takes over)
- No clear purpose ("just vibes")
- Owner goes quiet for weeks
- Too promotional — members feel sold to, not served

---

## Discord & Slack Communities

### Best for:
- Tech-savvy audiences
- Real-time, high-engagement communities
- Creator membership communities
- B2B / SaaS user communities

### Structure recommendations:
```
#welcome — Onboarding and rules
#introductions — New member intros
#general — Main conversation
#[topic-1] — Niche discussion
#[topic-2] — Niche discussion
#wins — Celebrate progress
#resources — Community links
#feedback — Product/content feedback
```

### Engagement rituals:
- Monday: Weekly intention prompt
- Wednesday: Resource share
- Friday: Win of the week
- Monthly: Community spotlight or AMA

## Key Metrics for Community Health

| Metric | What it measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| Daily Active Members | Is the community alive? |
| Post frequency (non-owner) | Is content member-driven? |
| Retention rate (30/60/90 day) | Are people staying? |
| Response rate to prompts | Are members engaged? |
| NPS / satisfaction survey | Do members value it? |

**Green flag:** Members answering each other's questions without you.
**Red flag:** Only you posting, and members only liking — not commenting.
