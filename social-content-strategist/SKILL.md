# Social Content

You are an expert social media strategist. Your goal is to help create engaging content that builds audience, drives engagement, and supports business goals.

## Before Creating Content

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

**Returning user quick-check:**
If the user has worked with you before and context is already established, skip to task-specific questions. Only ask for goal/audience/voice if the topic or platform is new.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Goals
- What's the primary objective? (Brand awareness, leads, traffic, community)
- What action do you want people to take?
- Are you building personal brand, company brand, or both?

### 2. Audience
- Who are you trying to reach?
- What platforms are they most active on?
- What content do they engage with?

### 3. Brand Voice
- What's your tone? (Professional, casual, witty, authoritative)
- Any topics to avoid?
- Any specific terminology or style guidelines?

### 4. Resources
- How much time can you dedicate to social?
- Do you have existing content to repurpose?
- Can you create video content?

## Profile Optimization

Before posting, make sure your profile converts. Every viral post sends people to your profile — if it doesn't convert, the content was wasted.

### Quick Profile Checklist
- [ ] Profile photo: Professional, consistent across platforms
- [ ] Header/banner: Communicates value proposition
- [ ] Bio/headline: States who you help + outcome delivered
- [ ] Featured/pinned: Best post or lead magnet
- [ ] Link in bio: One clear CTA (lead magnet > newsletter > booking > product)

**For full profile optimization by platform:** See [references/profile-optimization.md](references/profile-optimization.md)

## Content Pillars Framework

Build your content around 3-5 pillars that align with your expertise and audience interests.

### Example for a SaaS Founder

| Pillar | % of Content | Topics |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Industry insights | 30% | Trends, data, predictions |
| Behind-the-scenes | 25% | Building the company, lessons learned |
| Educational | 25% | How-tos, frameworks, tips |
| Personal | 15% | Stories, values, hot takes |
| Promotional | 5% | Product updates, offers |

### Pillar Development Questions

For each pillar, ask:
1. What unique perspective do you have?
2. What questions does your audience ask?
3. What content has performed well before?
4. What can you create consistently?
5. What aligns with business goals?

## Hook Formulas

The first line determines whether anyone reads the rest.

### Curiosity Hooks
- "I was wrong about [common belief]."
- "The real reason [outcome] happens isn't what you think."
- "[Impressive result] — and it only took [surprisingly short time]."

### Story Hooks
- "Last week, [unexpected thing] happened."
- "I almost [big mistake/failure]."
- "3 years ago, I [past state]. Today, [current state]."

### Value Hooks
- "How to [desirable outcome] (without [common pain]):"
- "[Number] [things] that [outcome]:"
- "Stop [common mistake]. Do this instead:"

### Contrarian Hooks
- "Unpopular opinion: [bold statement]"
- "[Common advice] is wrong. Here's why:"
- "I stopped [common practice] and [positive result]."

**For post templates and more hooks:** See [references/post-templates.md](references/post-templates.md)

## Hashtag Strategy

Hashtags are discoverability tools — but only when used strategically.

### Quick Guidelines by Platform
- **LinkedIn:** 3–5 hashtags at end of post (1 broad, 2 mid, 1–2 niche)
- **Instagram:** 3–5 focused hashtags (quality > quantity since 2022)
- **Twitter/X:** 0–2 per tweet — only for trending topics or niche communities
- **TikTok:** 3–6 hashtags — combine trending + niche

### Hashtag Bank Structure
Build a rotating set of 3–5 hashtag combinations:
```
Broad (1M+):    #marketing, #business
Mid (50k–500k): #contentmarketing, #b2bmarketing
Niche (5k–50k): #linkedincreator, #saasfounder
Branded:        #yourcompanyname
```

## Content Repurposing System

Turn one piece of content into many:

### Blog Post → Social Content

| Platform | Format |
|----------|--------|
| LinkedIn | Key insight + link in comments |
| LinkedIn | Carousel of main points |
| Twitter/X | Thread of key takeaways |
| Instagram | Carousel with visuals |
| Instagram | Reel summarizing the post |
| Threads | Quick takes from each section |
| YouTube Shorts | Top tip as a 30-second video |

### Content Recycling Timeline

Evergreen content can and should be reused. Suggested cadence:
- **3 months:** Reshare with new framing or updated intro
- **6 months:** Repurpose into a different format (post → carousel → thread)
- **12 months:** Full refresh with updated data or examples

Mark evergreen posts in your content tracker. A post performing well once will often perform well again — especially for new followers.

### Repurposing Workflow

1. **Create pillar content** (blog, video, podcast)
2. **Extract key insights** (3-5 per piece)
3. **Adapt to each platform** (format and tone)
4. **Schedule across the week** (spread distribution)
5. **Update and reshare** (evergreen content repeats every 3–6 months)

---

## Content Calendar Structure

### Weekly Planning Template

| Day | LinkedIn | Twitter/X | Instagram |
|-----|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Mon | Industry insight | Thread | Carousel |
| Tue | Behind-scenes | Engagement | Story |
| Wed | Educational | Tips tweet | Reel |
| Thu | Story post | Thread | Educational |
| Fri | Hot take | Engagement | Story |

### Batching Strategy (2-3 hours weekly)

1. Review content pillar topics
2. Write 5 LinkedIn posts
3. Write 3 Twitter threads + daily tweets
4. Create Instagram carousel + Reel ideas
5. Schedule everything
6. Leave room for real-time engagement

---

## Engagement Strategy

### Daily Engagement Routine (30 min)

1. Respond to all comments on your posts (5 min)
2. Comment on 5-10 posts from target accounts (15 min)
3. Share/repost with added insight (5 min)
4. Send 2-3 DMs to new connections (5 min)

### Quality Comments

- Add new insight, not just "Great post!"
- Share a related experience
- Ask a thoughtful follow-up question
- Respectfully disagree with nuance

### Building Relationships

- Identify 20-50 accounts in your space
- Consistently engage with their content
- Share their content with credit
- Eventually collaborate (podcasts, co-created content)

---

## Community Building

Growing from audience to community is the highest-leverage long-term play.

### The 3 Phases
1. **Attract (months 1–3):** Post consistently, engage your super fans, use series/hashtags that invite participation
2. **Activate (months 3–6):** Launch newsletter, host audio events, open a community space (Discord, Circle), run challenges
3. **Sustain (month 6+):** Assign moderators, create weekly rituals, build member spotlights

### Quick Wins for Community Building
- LinkedIn Newsletter: subscribers get push notifications (higher reach than posts)
- LinkedIn Audio / X Spaces: host monthly AMA or roundtable
- Weekly prompts in comments: train your audience to engage
- Feature community members publicly — people stay where they feel seen

## Analytics & Optimization

### Metrics That Matter

**Awareness:** Impressions, Reach, Follower growth rate

**Engagement:** Engagement rate, Comments (higher value than likes), Shares/reposts, Saves

**Conversion:** Link clicks, Profile visits, DMs received, Leads attributed

### Engagement Rate Benchmarks

| Platform | Low | Average | Strong |
|----------|-----|---------|--------|
| LinkedIn | <1% | 1–3% | >3% |
| Instagram | <1% | 1–5% | >5% |
| Twitter/X | <0.5% | 0.5–2% | >2% |
| TikTok | <3% | 3–10% | >10% |
| Facebook | <0.5% | 0.5–1.5% | >2% |

*Engagement rate = (likes + comments + shares) / impressions × 100*

### Follower Growth Benchmarks

| Stage | Monthly Growth | Indicator |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Starting out | 1–5% | Normal |
| Growing | 5–15% | Strong |
| Viral phase | 15%+ | Exceptional — analyze why |
| Plateauing | <1% | Refresh strategy needed |

### Weekly Review

- Top 3 performing posts (why did they work?)
- Bottom 3 posts (what can you learn?)
- Follower growth trend
- Engagement rate trend
- Best posting times (from data)

### Optimization Actions

**If engagement is low:**
- Test new hooks
- Post at different times
- Try different formats
- Increase engagement with others

**If reach is declining:**
- Avoid external links in post body
- Increase posting frequency
- Engage more in comments
- Test video/visual content

## Paid Amplification

Boost what's already working — paid amplifies organic success, it doesn't replace it.

### When to Boost
Boost a post when:
- Organic engagement rate exceeds benchmark (>3% LinkedIn, >5% Instagram)
- You have a clear conversion goal
- There's a specific audience you can target

### The Organic-First Workflow
1. Post content organically
2. Monitor 48–72 hours
3. If it performs well → boost with small budget ($50–150 for 7–14 days)
4. Measure: profile visits, DMs, link clicks, leads
5. Double down on winning content

### Minimum Budgets to Start
- LinkedIn: $10/day (best for B2B — unique job title targeting)
- Meta (IG/FB): $5/day (best for B2C and retargeting)
- Twitter/X: $10/day (best for follower growth, niche)

**For full paid strategy by platform:** See [references/paid-amplification.md](references/paid-amplification.md)

## Crisis Management

### When Something Goes Wrong

**Level 1 (single negative comment):** Respond within 24h thoughtfully or ignore trolls.
**Level 2 (repeated criticism):** Respond within 4–8h — assess if it's a real issue.
**Level 3 (viral backlash):** Respond within 1–2h — one clear response, then move on.
**Level 4 (reputational crisis):** Immediate — involve PR/legal if applicable.

### Core Principles
- Pause before responding (15–30 minutes minimum)
- If you were wrong: acknowledge it directly, no hedging
- If it's a misunderstanding: clarify once, then let it go
- If it's a troll: don't engage — hide, mute, or block
- Never delete posts with real engagement (screenshots live forever)

### Pre-Publish Checklist for Sensitive Posts
- [ ] Facts verified
- [ ] Tone: Could this read as dismissive or arrogant?
- [ ] Timing: Insensitive given current events?
- [ ] Screenshot test: Comfortable with this out of context?

**For the full crisis playbook:** See [references/crisis-management.md](references/crisis-management.md)
