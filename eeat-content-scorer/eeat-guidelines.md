# Google E-E-A-T Guidelines — Key Excerpts & Principles

the second "E" for Experience)

## What is E-E-A-T?

E-E-A-T stands for **Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and
Trustworthiness**. It is the framework Google's human Quality Raters use to
assess the quality of web content. It directly informs how Google's algorithms
rank content.

**Trustworthiness is the most important dimension.** The other three feed
into how trustworthy a page is.

## Experience

Added to the framework in December 2022. Google recognizes that first-hand
experience is a unique quality signal that AI-generated or purely researched
content cannot replicate.

**Signals of genuine experience:**
- Personal anecdotes with specific details (dates, names, outcomes)
- Original photos, screenshots, or documentation
- Unique data from personal experiments or work
- Opinions that only someone who has done the thing would have
- Acknowledgment of difficulties or failures — not just success stories

**Experience ≠ Expertise.** A patient writing about their cancer diagnosis has
experience. An oncologist has expertise. Both are valuable; they are different.

## Expertise

**Formal expertise:** Verifiable qualifications (MD, CPA, lawyer, certified
professional). Required for YMYL topics.

**Everyday expertise:** Deep personal knowledge from life experience. A
long-time hobbyist, parent, or enthusiast can demonstrate expertise without
formal credentials.

**Signs of genuine expertise:**
- Correct and precise use of technical vocabulary
- Awareness of nuance, exceptions, and edge cases
- Ability to explain *why*, not just *what*
- Addressing counterarguments or limitations
- Content that would not be written the same way by a non-expert

---

## Authoritativeness

Authority is **earned externally**, not self-declared.

**Strong authority signals:**
- Author has a verifiable track record in the niche (published books,
  academic papers, industry recognition)
- The publishing site is cited by other authoritative sites
- The page has backlinks from high-authority domains
- Author's byline links to a credible bio page
- Third-party mentions, press coverage, or awards

**Weak or missing authority signals:**
- Anonymous content
- Author bio that only lists credentials without external verification
- New or unknown site with no external references
- Excessive self-promotion without third-party validation

---

## Trustworthiness

Google states: "The most important member of the E-E-A-T family is
trustworthiness."

**On-page trust signals:**
- Clear authorship and editorial standards
- Last-updated date visible on the page
- Sources cited with links to originals
- Clear distinction between opinion and fact
- Disclosure of sponsorships, affiliates, or conflicts of interest
- Accurate, verifiable claims
- Contact information (email, address, phone)
- Privacy policy and terms of service

**Trust killers:**
- Clickbait headlines that don't match content
- Outdated statistics presented as current
- Missing or broken citations
- No author identified
- Unclear who is responsible for the content

## Highest Quality vs. Lowest Quality

### Highest Quality (what to aim for)
- Demonstrates all four E-E-A-T dimensions
- Content serves the user's need completely
- Original research, analysis, or reporting
- Expert or experienced author clearly identified
- Highly cited and recognized in the niche

### Lowest Quality (what to avoid — will be penalized)
- No E-E-A-T signals at all
- Misleading or inaccurate information
- Poor page experience
- Content that exists to rank, not to help
- Auto-generated or templated content with no human value-add
