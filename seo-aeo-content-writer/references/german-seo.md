# German-Language SEO — DACH Market Guide

## Language Variants

| Market | Code | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Germany | de-DE | Largest market, more formal |
| Switzerland | de-CH | Hochdeutsch, use "ss" not "ß" for Swiss |
| Austria | de-AT | Similar to DE, minor vocabulary differences |

**Critical**: Swiss German uses "ss" instead of "ß" (e.g. "Strasse" not "Straße").
Always confirm locale before writing German content.

## Keyword Research in German

- German keywords are NOT direct translations of English ones
- Users often use full compound nouns: "Webseite erstellen lassen" not just "Webseite"
- Formal language dominates B2B searches
- Regional modifiers matter: "Zürich", "Schweiz", "DACH"

### High-value German keyword patterns
```
[Service] + [Stadt/Region]       → "Webflow Agentur Zürich"
[Service] + Kosten/Preise        → "Webflow Entwickler Kosten Schweiz"
[Service] + Anbieter/Experte     → "SEO Experte Schweiz"
[Tool] + Alternative             → "WordPress Alternative Schweiz"
[Problem] + Lösung               → "Website Performance verbessern"
Was ist + [Term]                 → "Was ist Webflow"
[Term] + erklärt                 → "CMS erklärt"
```

## Tone & Register

### B2B (default for agency/consultancy content)
- Formal "Sie" form throughout
- Professional but not stiff — clarity matters more than formality
- Avoid filler phrases: "natürlich", "selbstverständlich" used excessively signals AI

### B2C
- Depends on brand; "du" form increasingly common for tech/startup brands
- Always confirm with client before writing

### Swiss-specific
- Neutral, measured tone — avoid superlatives and hyperbole
- Swiss audiences are skeptical of aggressive sales copy
- Quality signals: certifications, case studies, local references

## DACH Search Landscape

- **Google dominates**: 90%+ market share in DACH
- **Bing/Ecosia**: minor but growing (Ecosia popular in CH/DE eco-conscious segment)
- **AI Overviews**: Rolling out in DACH — AEO increasingly important
- **Local search**: City + service combinations extremely competitive in CH

## Trust Signals for DACH Audiences

Include where relevant:
- Swiss/German company registration (UID / CHE number)
- Physical address (essential for LocalBusiness schema)
- Certifications: ISO, industry bodies, partner badges (e.g. Webflow Partner)
- German-language testimonials from local clients
- DACH-relevant case studies

## Avoid

- Anglicisms where German equivalents exist (unless brand voice requires)
- Over-punctuation (Swiss/German style is cleaner than UK/US)
- Exclamation marks in headings (perceived as pushy)
- Vague CTAs: use specific actions ("Beratung vereinbaren" not just "Kontaktieren")
