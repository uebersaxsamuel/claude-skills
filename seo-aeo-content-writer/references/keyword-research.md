# Keyword Research & Intent Mapping

## Keyword Classification

### By Intent
| Type | User goal | Best content format |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| Informational | Learn something | Blog post, guide, explainer |
| Commercial | Compare options | Comparison, listicle, review |
| Transactional | Buy / hire | Landing page, service page |
| Navigational | Find a specific site | Homepage / brand page |

### By Funnel Stage
- **TOFU** (Awareness): broad informational → "was ist webflow"
- **MOFU** (Consideration): comparative → "webflow vs wordpress für unternehmen"
- **BOFU** (Decision): specific transactional → "webflow agentur schweiz beauftragen"

## Keyword Clustering

Group semantically related keywords into topic clusters. Each cluster gets one
pillar page + supporting blog posts.

Example cluster for a Webflow agency:
```
Pillar: "Webflow Agentur Schweiz"
  ├── "Webflow Entwickler Zürich"
  ├── "Webflow Website erstellen lassen"
  ├── "Webflow Kosten Schweiz"
  ├── "Webflow CMS erklärt"
  └── "Webflow vs WordPress Schweiz"
```

## SERP Feature Targeting

### Featured Snippet (Position 0)
- Trigger: question-based queries ("wie", "was ist", "how to")
- Format: 40–60 word definition paragraph OR numbered list
- Placement: Answer the question directly in the first 150 words

### People Also Ask (PAA)
- Use PAA questions as H2/H3 headings
- Answer each in 50–80 words directly below the heading

### AI Overviews (Google)
- Appear for complex informational queries
- Google synthesizes from multiple pages — be the clearest, most direct source
- Use: short paragraphs, clear statements, named entities, statistics with sources

### Local Pack
- Trigger: "near me" or city-based queries
- Requires: Google Business Profile + LocalBusiness schema + NAP consistency

## Competitive Gap Analysis

When analyzing competitors, look for:
1. **Missing subtopics** — what do top 3 cover that you don't?
2. **Thin FAQ coverage** — which PAA questions are unanswered?
3. **Outdated content** — dates matter; fresher content gets preference
4. **Missing schema** — if competitors lack FAQPage schema, adding it is a quick win

## LSI & Semantic Keywords

Google's NLP reads the whole document. Include semantically related terms:

Example — primary keyword "Webflow SEO":
- Technical SEO, meta tags, sitemap, canonical, structured data
- CMS SEO, page speed, Core Web Vitals
- Webflow Editor, Webflow hosting
- Search engine optimization, Google ranking

Use tools like: Google autocomplete, Related Searches, AlsoAsked.com,
Semrush / Ahrefs (if available).
